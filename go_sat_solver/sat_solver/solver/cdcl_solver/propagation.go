/*
 * Performs unit propagation using TWLRecord data structure.
 * This data structure is described here:
 *   http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mfleury/sat_twl.pdf
 *
 * For code reference please see (Minisat solver):
 *   https://github.com/niklasso/minisat/blob/master/minisat/core/Solver.cc#L506
 *
 * The unit propagation use benefit of the Watched Literals algorithm.
 * The key idea is to maintain list of "watched" literals in each clause such that the following invariant holds:
 *
 *    Watched literal is iff the other watched literal is true and all the unwatched literals are false.
 *
 * [Direct citation from the linked work "A Verified SAT Solver with Watched Literals Using Imperative HOL"]:
 *
 *   For each literal L, the clauses that contain a watched L are
 *   chained together in a list, called a watch list. When a literal L
 *   becomes true, the solver needs to iterate only through the
 *   watch list for −L to find candidates for propagation or conflict. For each candidate clause, there are four possibilities:
 *     1. If the other watched literal is true, do nothing.
 *     2. If one of the unwatched literals L' is not false, restore the invariant by updating the clause so that it watches L' instead of −L.
 *     3. Otherwise, consider the other watched literal L' in the clause:
 *       3.1. If it is not set, propagate L'
 *       3.2. Otherwise, L' is false, and we have found a conflict
 *
 * This code follows those checks.
